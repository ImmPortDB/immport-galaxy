This tool allows one to process an existing Galaxy dataset collection's metadata as tabular data, 
apply a series of rules to it, and generate a new collection. When used interactively in the tool
form, a dynamic preview of the processing will be available in a tabular data viewer but this tool
may be used in workflows as well where no such preview can be generated.

This tool is an advanced feature but has a lot of flexibility - it can be used to process collections
with arbitrary nesting and can do many kinds of filtering, re-sorting, nesting,
flattening, and arbitrary combinations thereof not possible with Galaxy's other, more simple 
collection operation tools.

More information about the rule processor in general can be found `here
<https://github.com/jmchilton/training-material/blob/rules/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-rules/tutorial.md>`__ (this link is to documentation that is pretty rough still).

This tool will create new history datasets from your collection but your quota usage will not increase.
