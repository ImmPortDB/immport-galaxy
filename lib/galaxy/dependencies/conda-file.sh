# Conda does not have all of Galaxy's dependencies, and the list of which ones it does is always changing. As a result,
# it's not possible to keep a conda requirements file up to date. However, with Conda >= 4.4, we can use Conda itself to
# determine which dependencies it can install. Pip will be used (upon Galaxy startup) to install the rest.
#
# You should use this script like so:
#
# conda create --override-channels -c bioconda -c conda-forge -c defaults \
#     -n <env> --file <(lib/galaxy/dependencies/conda-file.sh) python=2.7
