densityplot	Density Plots using FlowDensity	FlowDensity is used to automatically gate cellular debris for FCS that need it. Check out the gating tool to see it in action, or generate scatter plots of your markers of interest from your FCS files.			densityplot.png
3dscatter	Interactive 3D Scatter Plot	3 markers can be better than two to study cell populations. Select your preferred markers and play around with the visualization of the FLOCK output to see how they differ from one another.			3dplot.png
stackeda	Compare samples	Follow the distribution of populations between samples.			plot.png
pcplot	Behold the power of Parallel Coordinate Graphs	Compare markers and samples in one interactive look			pcplot.png
flowai	FCS QC with flowAI	Generate a quality control report of each of your FCS files using flowAI, which checks flow rate, signal acquisition and dynamic range of the data.			qcflowai.png
flowsom	Generate a Self-Organizing Map with FlowSOM	FlowSOM offers visualization options for cytometry data, by using Self-Organizing Map clustering and Minimal Spanning Trees.			flowsom.png
clustergrammer	Interactive Heatmaps!	Generate a heatmap of your centroids with Clustergrammer. This heatmap is interactive and allows to zoom in and out, sort, re-order your cluster or populations profile.			clustergrammer.png
