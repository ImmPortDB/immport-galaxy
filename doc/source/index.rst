Building this Documentation
==========================

If you have your own copy of the Galaxy source code, you can also generate your own version of this documentation:

::

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

The generated documentation will be in ``doc/build/html/`` and can be viewed with a web browser.  Note that you will need to install Sphinx and a fair number of module dependencies before this will produce output.
